Research-grade evaluation of human-like cognitive capabilities grounded in peer-reviewed literature. All 50 prompts target specific constructs. All assertions are deterministic boolean predicates.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$PWD python tests/cognitive/test_cognitive_battery.py
```

**Result: 50/50 (100.0%) across 3 consecutive runs on Llama 3.1 8B**

## 1000-Prompt Cognitive Evaluation Suite

A research-grade evaluation with 1000 prompts across 8 cognitive domains, 40 constructs, and 35 long-horizon decay scenarios. Uses semantic cosine similarity scoring (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) instead of keyword matching, plus ecology invariant auditing to verify internal belief mechanics.

```bash
# Validate prompt bank structure (no API needed)
python -m tests.cognitive.eval.run --dry-run

# Full 1000-prompt run against live backend
python -m tests.cognitive.eval.run

# Quick smoke test (stratified across all domains)
python -m tests.cognitive.eval.run --max 24

# Target specific domains
python -m tests.cognitive.eval.run --domains reasoning social_cognition

# Verbose logging
python -m tests.cognitive.eval.run --max 50 -v
```

**Baseline Result: 825/1000 (82.5%), 95% CI [0.800, 0.848]**

Mean cosine similarity: 0.875. Zero ecology violations.

| Domain | Passed | Rate | Mean Cosine | Constructs |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|------------|
| Episodic Memory | 121/125 | 96.8% | 0.93 | encoding, temporal/spatial retrieval, temporal ordering, source monitoring |
| Working Memory | 118/125 | 94.4% | 0.92 | multi-item encoding, item retrieval, interference resistance, feature binding, updating |
| Semantic Memory | 116/125 | 92.8% | 0.93 | fact encoding, categorical inference, property retrieval, source discrimination, knowledge update |
| Selective Attention | 107/125 | 85.6% | 0.89 | target encoding, distractor filtering, inhibition, relevance gating, focused retrieval |
| Self-Correction | 103/125 | 82.4% | 0.91 | belief revision, iterative revision, long-horizon decay, minimal change, revision verification |
| Reasoning | 99/125 | 79.2% | 0.85 | modus ponens, modus tollens, analogical, transitive inference, causal reasoning |
| Language Comprehension | 88/125 | 70.4% | 0.83 | disambiguation, figurative language, indirect speech, presupposition, scalar implicature |
| Social Cognition | 73/125 | 58.4% | 0.75 | false belief, perspective taking, emotional inference, intention attribution, moral reasoning |

The social_cognition shortfall is primarily from moral_reasoning (20 of 52 failures): the LLM deflects ethical dilemmas with refusal responses instead of reasoning through them. This is an LLM-level behavior, not a belief ecology defect.

**Top failure constructs**: moral_reasoning (20), scalar_implicature (12), disambiguation (11), focused_retrieval (9), false_belief (9), analogical_reasoning (8).

### Eval Architecture

The 1000-prompt suite lives in [tests/cognitive/eval/](../tests/cognitive/eval/) and consists of 7 modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [prompt_bank.py](../tests/cognitive/eval/prompt_bank.py) | 1000 prompts: 8 domains, 40 constructs, gold answers, forbidden semantics, ecology checks |
| [scorer.py](../tests/cognitive/eval/scorer.py) | Semantic cosine similarity scoring via all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings |
| [ecology_auditor.py](../tests/cognitive/eval/ecology_auditor.py) | 7 belief-state invariant checks: creation, reinforcement, tension, mutation, salience decay, dormancy, orphan links |
| [stats.py](../tests/cognitive/eval/stats.py) | Clopper-Pearson exact binomial CI (pure Python, no scipy), per-domain distributions, test-retest correlation |
| [reporter.py](../tests/cognitive/eval/reporter.py) | Terminal summary, Markdown report, JSON artifact generation |
| [harness.py](../tests/cognitive/eval/harness.py) | Async runner with session grouping, stratified sampling, long-horizon decay cycling |
| [run.py](../tests/cognitive/eval/run.py) | CLI entry point: `--dry-run`, `--max`, `--domains`, `--constructs`, `--concurrency`, `--threshold` |

Each prompt carries: `domain`, `construct`, `gold_answer`, `forbidden_semantics`, `ecology_checks`, `session_group`, `is_setup`, `horizon`, and an academic `reference`. Setup prompts establish context (470 total); probe prompts test recall and reasoning (530 total). Long-horizon prompts (35 total) inject decay cycles between setup and probe to test salience persistence.

Scoring uses cosine similarity between the LLM response and the gold answer embedding. Pass threshold: 0.70. Forbidden answers are checked with a 0.60 ceiling. The ecology auditor runs invariant checks against pre/post belief snapshots fetched via `GET /beliefs/{id}/ecology`.
